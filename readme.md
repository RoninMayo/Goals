# Purpose
This repository was created as part of one of my yearly goals to improve in Python. 

I have spent time learning the basic structures in Python (integer/float/boolean/string, operators, input), as well as more advanced structures (for/while loops, functions, sequences, file handling). 

After I thought I had a decent general misunderstanding of Python, I moved on to learning a library. Libraries are simply collections of code that someone else has already written. I found my best options to be netmiko or paramiko. Netmiko has multi-vendor support, simple command execution/output, supports common networking devices (switches/routers/firewalls), and is user friendly for non-programmers. On the other hand, paramiko offers extremely granular control over any device that supports SSH. Factoring that, I chose netmiko as it is more suited to my needs.

I have setup a basic home lab comprised of a Cisco 3750 switch and 1841 router. I also had one Juniper device, however this was DoA. Home lab has allowed me to learn by doing things (rather than spending hours studying) without being fearful of making mistakes as i always have a console connection available in the worst case scenario.
